# SimonSaysGame
we use basic html,css and javascript to build this small game.
In this game,we use four div's in html along with headlines of h1 and h2
In javascript we use MAINLY six functions along with some declarations and a eventlisterner
In style.css we have many lines and even use "display flex" ,to arrange the div's in proper manner..
